# PromoterManifest
This repository provides all Matlab code used for "Promoters adopt distinct dynamic manifestations depending on transcription factor context" by AS Hansen and C Zechner (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/650762v2).

# Manifestation database
In the directory "Tutorial" we provide simple tutorial-like example code to plot the inferred transcriptional features for different promoters and conditions. The folder contains two files: 
1) PlotPromoterFeatures.m: this file plots two transcriptional features against each others for all single-pulse conditions and a particular promoter. The results show population averages and standard errors.
2) PlotTemporalReconstructions.m this file plots the temporal reconstructions of promoter state probabilities and transcription rates as a function of time for a single condition and promoter. The results show population averages and standard errors (when applicable).
